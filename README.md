# Critterpedia

Critterpedia is an App for Animal Crossing: New Horizons players who want to know what bugs, fish, and sea creatures are currently available to catch on their island.
Different creatures appear depending on the time of year and day as well as in-game location so this is useful information to keep track of!

Critterpedia is built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML and uses the [ACNH API](http://acnhapi.com/) for Animal Crossing critter data.
